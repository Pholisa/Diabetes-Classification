The chosen dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/code/mbalvi75/08-knn-diabetes-dataset  

The chosen dataset is appropriate for analysis with classification because of the following 
reasons: 
The dataset consists of diabetes information, with columns consisting of Pregnancy, Glucose, 
Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age, and Outcomes. 
This dataset is capable of predicting whether a patient has diabetes or not. As described before 
classification is all about predicting which category something belongs to, predicting 
categorical variables. This dataset has categorical target variables, it can predict whether a 
patient has diabetes or not. 

This dataset presents binary classification, in that the aim is to classify the input variables into 
one of two classes, in this case, whether a patient is diabetic or not. It can also present other 
classifications, for diabetes and the types of diabetes. This dataset is labelled. The disease can 
be predicted using classification algorithms. Cross-validation can take place, which involves 
evaluating the performance of the model on the data that is unseen. The dataset can be split 
into a training and testing set. The desired output will be given after the data has been trained 
and tested. The number of columns in this dataset is known, there are 9 columns. 

The probability of a patient getting diabetes can be calculated based on the chosen features, a 
pattern can be established by observing the features. The features are normally distributed 
because they are continuous, and there is no missing data (all the rows have data with their 
respective columns). The features are independent of each other; Pregnancy and Skin 
Thickness are independent. The features in the dataset are relevant to what is being predicted, 
which is diabetes, Glucose, Age, Insulin etc. play a role in the prediction of diabetes. 
The dataset has consistent values in the columns, all the values are numerical, and there are no 
words thrown around. The dataset can be loaded effectively because it is in Excel, making it 
appropriate in this case.
